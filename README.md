# OtakuWorld
 ![visitors](https://page-views.glitch.me/badge?page_id=jakepurple13.OtakuWorld)
 
A combined version of my [MangaWorld](https://github.com/jakepurple13/MangaWorld) and [AnimeWorld](https://github.com/jakepurple13/AnimeWorld) apps. This was created because there were a ton of shared elements between the two apps so I combined them, allowing two separate apps but a lot of the same base logic.

## [Latest Release](https://github.com/jakepurple13/OtakuWorld/releases/latest)
